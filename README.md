So it is very essential to track the service and analyze the data such us “who orders more”, “preference of each customers”, “which items sell good in which location”, etc… to increase profit.

Running an e-commerce easy nowadays, but analyzing the data is hard. It is required to analyze the data to predict future growth. For example if you know which location sells which product more then you can keep more stock in location, etc.			

##### Ambitious and complex graph
There are many vertexes and edges related to e-commerce site is used in the solution. Most of the task in e-commerce app is simple like (select, insert & update). But it has some hard parts when analyzing the data. Analyzing the data requires large amount of relationships for the table.
